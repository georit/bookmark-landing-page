## The challenge

The challenge is to build out a landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the newsletter form is submitted if:
  - The input field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
